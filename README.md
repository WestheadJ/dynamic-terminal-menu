# dynamic-terminal-menu
C# code for creating an interactive dynamic menu system for a terminal

## What is it?
For one of my Year 2 Uni projects, we were to create a CLI/Terminal application. I picked out creatinf a rental car system. I often wondered instead of waiting for a number input from a user and them selecting the wrong option, how about have an interactive menu like a GUI, but in the termnial. I also wanted to create something modular, this being the menu incase I wanted to use it elsewhere in the program.
